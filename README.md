# 🌸 Joyphul  
*A gratitude-sharing app that helps people notice, plant, and share the small joys in everyday life.*  

---

## ✨ Overview  
Joyphul is a lightweight social app designed to encourage gratitude and connection.  
Users can **🌱 Plant a Seed** (share a joyful thought, memory, or moment), browse others’ **blooms** in the feed, and comment to spread positivity.  

The goal is to create a digital garden of everyday joys — one that grows through individual contributions and fosters community well-being.  

---

## 🌱 Problem  
- Many people struggle to notice or hold onto small daily joys.  
- Existing gratitude apps are either overly private (journaling only) or overly social (Instagram/TikTok), which discourages authentic sharing.  
- There’s no lightweight, community-driven platform focused on gratitude as the central habit.  

---

## 🌸 Solution  
Joyphul provides:  
- A **simple, low-friction posting flow** ("Plant a Seed").  
- A **communal feed** ("The Garden") where joys are shared and celebrated.  
- **Commenting** to encourage connection and empathy.  
- A **flower/garden theme** that reinforces growth, positivity, and care.
